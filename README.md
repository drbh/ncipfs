## Welcome to NCIPFS

This project makes it easy to secure data on IPFS with NuCyphers awesome proxy re encryption. This libaray is under development and are finializing the API.

### Example Scenario:  

`David` wants to upload a 1 TB file and allow `Kathy` and `Joe` access. 

Traditionally he would ask `Kathy` and `Joe` for their respecive public keys and then he would encrypt the data twice; once for each key. Then store the encrypted value somewhere they could retrived it. He'll use IPFS as this datastore. 

However NuCyphers proxy re-encryption allows us to encrypt the data once, then re-encrypt new keys that will allow the two parties access. In this system we only encrypt the 1 TB once, and only store 1 TB on IPFS, this saves us storage space, encryption time, and ecryption computations.

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Y**ou **O**nly **E**ncrypt **O**nce **(Y.O.E.O kinda like Y.O.L.O)**  
‚úÖ Verified (immutable data store)  
‚úÖ Only re-encrypt keys for viewers  
‚úÖ Distributed - no single point of failure  
‚úÖ Can run federated (centralized) or distributed (ECR20 token incentivized)  

### Use cases

üí° Distributing large datasets  
üí° Distributing data to many people  
üí° IOT datastored (check out the original hearbeat example)  

### Implementations

üê• Python 3 (stable IPFS and NuCypher codebases)  
ü•ö Node JS (waiting on stable NyCypher codebase)  
ü•ö Golang (waiting on stable NyCypher codebase) 


## Installation

### Library

```
pip install ncipfs
```

### Development

```python
git clone https://github.com/drbh/ncipfs.git
cd ncipfs.git
```

We use `pipenv` to manage any of the deps
```
# install deps and access virtual env
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## Implementation

On the top level there is a class named **NCIPFS**. This class handles the connection to an **IPFS Gateway** a **NuCypher Network** and access to **Local File Store** that handles all of the users keys.
